# file-handling ðŸ“‚
A small C++ application written to explore file handling through the command line.

## Goals:
- The user is asked to input a filename which the application will then attempt to read.
- Once entered. The application will attempt to open the file and print its contents. If the application is unable to open the file, it will return an error message and allow the user to try again.
- Next, the application asks for the user to input the new contents of the file.
- Once entered, the application will overwrite the file contents with the user's input to be
read the next time the file is opened.
- All compilation/running the application will happen through a makefile.

## Knowledge gained
1. Introduction to C++.
2. Learning what a makefile is and what it does.
3. How to compile C++ from command line & through a makefile.
6. What Unix is.
7. Command line experience.
